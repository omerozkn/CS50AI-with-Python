---->how to program player(board) function:
#The player function should take a board state as input, and return which playerâ€™s turn it is (either X or O).
#In the initial game state, X gets the first move. Subsequently, the player alternates with each additional move.
#Any return value is acceptable if a terminal board is provided as input (i.e., the game is already over).

----> how to program actions(board)
#Returns set of all possible actions (i, j) available on the board.
#The actions function should return a set of all of the possible actions that can be taken on a given board.
#Each action should be represented as a tuple (i, j) where i corresponds to the row of the move (0, 1, or 2) and j corresponds to which cell 
in the row corresponds to the move (also 0, 1, or 2).
#Possible moves are any cells on the board that do not already have an X or an O in them.
#Any return value is acceptable if a terminal board is provided as input.
-->how can I implement this?
# first check if the game is over
# create a empty set for all the possible actions
#program needs to look for evry cells in the borad and if the cell is empty it should add a tuple (i, j) to the set of possible actions
