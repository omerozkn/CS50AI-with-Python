---->how to program player(board) function:
#The player function should take a board state as input, and return which playerâ€™s turn it is (either X or O).
#In the initial game state, X gets the first move. Subsequently, the player alternates with each additional move.
#Any return value is acceptable if a terminal board is provided as input (i.e., the game is already over).
